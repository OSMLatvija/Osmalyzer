You can also download the project and run it locally. (This is a C# .NET solution. The main project is a console project. Download the whole solution and open it in Visual Studio or any compatible IDE (like Visual Code, Rider, MonoDevelop, etc.) Compile and run as per your IDE (e.g. F5 in Visual Studio). You will need to download and install Nuget packages (i.e. external libraries), depending on how your IDE does this - this should be automatic or prompted the first time you try to compile/run the project.)
